Introduction
------------

Coda Analysis, is a collection of python code intended for the processing of the coda or diffuse portion of recorded waveforms. The basic structure of the raw input data is a series of recorded Time-Series (TSdata), and the corresponding time-matched Perturbation Vectors (PVdata). The intended application of this package of code is for the monitoring of changes in material properties due to some perturbation.
